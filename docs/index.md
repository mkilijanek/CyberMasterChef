# CyberMasterChef

A clean-slate, modular, and secure workbench for data operations — successor to CyberChef.

- Current release includes: Binary/URL codecs, `text.reverse`, auto-bake, run-to-step execution, deep-link sharing, search by operation ID with match counters, `Ctrl/Cmd+K` catalog focus shortcut, quick recipe JSON copy in Workbench, trace step counters, CyberChef recipe import/export (Workbench + CLI) with detailed import warnings and import-source indicator, timeout-controlled execution in both Workbench and CLI, and a golden recipe regression baseline.
